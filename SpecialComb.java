/*Given an array of integers, find the combination of integers forming a sequence which satisfies 
the below conditions:

    The ith integer must satisfy the given equation in the sequence

2. The length of the sequence must be maximum possible

3. If there is more than one sequence satisfying above two conditions then print that sequence which 
contains least integers.
In case there is no combination of integers possible then print -1.
See the example below:

Example 1:
If the given integers are 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 10, 11, 19 then the possible combinations of integers 
satisfying above conditions are 2, 3, 5, 8 and 3, 8, 11, 19 and hence the output must be 2, 3, 5, 8. 
Here you cannot form any other combination of integers whose length is greater than 4 and satisfies the given equation.
Example 2:
If the given integers are 1,5,6,10 then print -1.*/
